- basic electrical safety (good connectors, wires, etc)
- ground the metal parts of the printer
- temp sensors on anything that can get hot, even 2 different sensors for redundancy
- if running 2 different sensors, a mains cut-off with a hard max temp limit separate from printer
- smoke sensor(s)
- some kind of automatic fire extinguisher above printer
- audible alarms
- remote notifications
- camera(s) to watch prints
- ai to detect printing errors (like the octoprint plugin)
- (external) mosfets with heatsinks / active cooling and maybe temperature sensors

and since we automated for remote usage
- automated nozzle cleaning after heatup / before start print
